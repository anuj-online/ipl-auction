# Backend-Mediated WebSocket Connection Implementation

## Overview

The auction system has been successfully migrated from direct frontend-to-WebSocket connections to a **backend-mediated architecture** using Server-Sent Events (SSE). This solves critical issues with authentication, connection management, and hardcoded URLs while providing better scalability and monitoring.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Direct WebSocket)
```
Frontend UI ‚Üí Direct WebSocket Connection ‚Üí WebSocket Server
```
**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Multiple hardcoded WebSocket URLs across components
- ‚ùå Different ports used inconsistently (3001, 8080, 3003) 
- ‚ùå Authentication bypass issues
- ‚ùå Poor connection state management
- ‚ùå 400 Bad Request errors during admin operations

### After (Backend-Mediated SSE)
```
Frontend UI ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí WebSocket Manager ‚Üí WebSocket Server
           ‚Üë               ‚Üì
           SSE Stream ‚Üê Event Broadcasting
```
**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Centralized port configuration
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication through backend APIs
- ‚úÖ Reliable connection management
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and recovery
- ‚úÖ Consistent connection state across components

## Implementation Details

### 1. Centralized Configuration (`src/lib/config.ts`)
- **Environment-based port management**
- **Validation and type safety**
- **Single source of truth for all WebSocket settings**

Key features:
- Port conflict detection
- Configuration validation on startup
- Debug logging for development
- Production-ready environment variable loading

### 2. WebSocket Manager (`src/lib/websocket-manager.ts`)
- **Backend service for managing WebSocket connections**
- **Authentication and session validation**
- **Connection pooling and limits**

Key features:
- User connection limits (max 3 per user)
- System connection limits (max 1000 total)
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- SSE client management
- Event broadcasting to auction participants

### 3. Frontend Connection Service (`src/lib/auction-connection.ts`)
- **SSE-based real-time communication**
- **Automatic reconnection handling**
- **Clean API for bidding and admin controls**

Key features:
- Promise-based connection establishment
- Automatic heartbeat monitoring
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Unified interface for bids and admin commands

### 4. Backend API Endpoints

#### Connection Management (`/api/auction/connection`)
- `POST` - Establish/disconnect connections
- `GET` - Check connection status
- `DELETE` - Admin force disconnect

#### Event Streaming (`/api/auction/events/[connectionId]`)
- Server-Sent Events endpoint
- Real-time auction event broadcasting
- Automatic client management

### 5. Updated Frontend Components

#### Admin Live Page (`src/app/admin/auctions/live/page.tsx`)
- Replaced direct WebSocket with SSE connection service
- Improved connection status display
- Better error handling for admin controls

#### Team Dashboard (`src/app/team/page.tsx`)
- SSE-based real-time bidding
- Enhanced connection reliability
- Mobile-friendly connection management

#### Admin Team Status (`src/app/admin/teams/status/page.tsx`)
- Real-time team monitoring via SSE
- Improved connection indicators
- Better reconnection handling

## Environment Configuration

### Updated `.env` File
```bash
# Centralized Port Configuration
NEXT_APP_PORT=3002          # Main Next.js app
WEBSOCKET_PORT=3003         # WebSocket server  
SSE_PORT=3004              # Server-Sent Events

# WebSocket Settings
WEBSOCKET_HOST=localhost
WS_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=60000
WS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL=30000
WS_RECONNECT_INTERVAL=5000
WS_MAX_RETRIES=5

# Connection Limits
MAX_WEBSOCKET_CONNECTIONS=1000
MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_USER=3
```

## Connection Flow

### 1. Connection Establishment
```typescript
// Frontend requests backend connection
const response = await fetch('/api/auction/connection', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'connect',
    auctionId: 'current'
  })
})

// Backend validates session and creates WebSocket connection
const result = await wsManager.establishConnection(userId, role, auctionId)

// Frontend subscribes to SSE stream
const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/auction/events/${connectionId}`)
```

### 2. Real-time Event Flow
```typescript
// WebSocket server receives auction event
// ‚Üì
// Backend WebSocket Manager processes event
// ‚Üì 
// Event broadcasted to all SSE clients in auction
// ‚Üì
// Frontend receives event via SSE stream
eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const auctionEvent = JSON.parse(event.data)
  handleAuctionEvent(auctionEvent)
}
```

### 3. Bidding Process
```typescript
// Frontend sends bid via backend API
const result = await auctionConnection.sendBid({
  lotId: 'lot_123',
  amount: 5000000
})

// Backend validates bid and forwards to WebSocket server
// WebSocket server processes bid and broadcasts result
// All connected clients receive bid update via SSE
```

## Key Benefits
